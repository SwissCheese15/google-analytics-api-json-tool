# Google Analytics Reporting API Tool

This tool can be used to retrieve data via the Google Analytics Reporting API.
The raison-d-Ãªtre of this tool is the fact that the API limits it's responses by 1000.
If someone wants to retrieve large amounts of data, dozens or hundreds of separate requests have to be made.

With this tool, these requests are automatically executed and the reveived data is gathered and combined.

## Output
A JSON file with the data of all the chained requests.

## Usage
- Select what metrics you want incuded
